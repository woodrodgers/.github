## :wave: About
This is the open source hub for the Design Technology team at [Wood Rodgers](https://www.woodrodgers.com/), a multi-disciplinary civil engineering firm with offices in California and Nevada. We share our contributions here because we want to make a positive impact on our communities and the AEC industry. 

As an industry, we're on the verge of a paradigm shift in the way that infrastructure projects are planned, designed, built, and operated. Technology is challenging the established norms about not only _how_ we do our work, but _what_ the nature of that work is. A profound transformation towards digital processes and deliverables is underway, but there is much work still to be done.

We're excited to get some skin in the game and share our open source contributions with the community! :metal:

## :muscle: Challenge. Innovate. Create.
Innovation is in our DNA Wood Rodgers. We're an engineering firm that doesn’t feel like one, with an unmistakable sense of something different. As an industry, we have fallen prey to the stereotype of humorless, narrow-sighted and boring engineers. Wood Rodgers, however, is anything but stereotypical. We are visionaries. The people and the spirit driving our company are open-minded, creative, and passionate about uncovering new and exciting solutions. We challenge everything…because everything needs to be challenged.
